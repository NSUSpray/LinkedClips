LinkedClips is MIDI remote script for Ableton Live. As soon as you install
it, clips with the same name will be linked: change the notes in one clip --
the notes in the others will change. In addition to notes, the script binds
colors, loops, time signatures, grids, as well as gains, transposes and warp
modes for audio clips.
Alas, the script is far from the ideal due to the Live API limitations:
- does not always work correctly with arrangement clips
- does not affect modulation, markers and parameters of warping
- buggy undo/redo
In short, use with caution.
